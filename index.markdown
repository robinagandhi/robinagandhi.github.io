Bio:  
Robin Gandhi is the Associate Dean of Research, Technology and Facilities as the College of Information Science and Technology, University of Nebraska at Omaha. He currently holds the Charles W. and Margre H. Durham Distinguished Professorship and is a Professor of Cybersecurity. He received his Ph.D. in Information Technology from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. His research interests are in the areas of software security engineering, requirements modeling and analysis, data preservation for scientific workflows, and system certification and accreditation. Since the security of systems is a design problem, his work focuses on developing and assessing models that promote problem-solving in security engineering activities. He has designed courses and training materials that promote a culture of software security engineering in the development processes. His efforts have brought software security engineering, as part of a larger systems certification perspective, to the forefront of the US federal assessment and authorization processes for IT systems. He also serves as a CWE/CAPEC Board Member. In his spare time, he loves to go on bike rides with his kids, play pickleball, and explore new hiking trails.
