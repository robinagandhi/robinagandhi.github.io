### Robin Gandhi
Charles W. and Margre H. Durham Distinguished Professor   
of College of Information Science and Technology
Associate Professor of Cybersecurity  
University of Nebraska at Omaha  

Robin received his Ph.D. in Information Technology from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He loves to do research in the areas of secure software engineering, security requirements modeling and analysis, data preservation for scientific workflows, and system certification and accreditation. Since security of systems is a design problem, his work focuses on designing and assessing models that promote problem-solving for cybersecurity. He has designed courses and training materials that promote a culture of secure software engineering in development processes. His efforts have brought software security engineering, as part of a larger systems certification perspective, to the forefront of the US federal assessment and authorization processes for IT systems. In his spare time, he loves to go on bike rides with his kids and explore new trails.
