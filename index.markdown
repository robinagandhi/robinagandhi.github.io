Robin Gandhi is a Charles W. and Margre H. Durham Distinguished Professor of Cybersecurity at the College of Information Science and Technology, University of Nebraska at Omaha. He serves as the Director of the School of Interdisciplinary Informatics. He received his Ph.D. in Information Technology from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. His research interests are in the areas of software security engineering, requirements modeling and analysis, data preservation for scientific workflows, and system certification and accreditation. Since the security of systems is a design problem, his work focuses on developing and assessing models that promote problem-solving in security engineering activities. He has designed courses and training materials that promote a culture of software security engineering in the development processes. His efforts have brought software security engineering, as part of a larger systems certification perspective, to the forefront of the US federal assessment and authorization processes for IT systems. In his spare time, he loves to go on bike rides with his kids and explore new trails.
