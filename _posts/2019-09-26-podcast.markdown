The University of Nebraska today announced a new podcast series that will share stories of researchers, students and educators across NU’s four campuses who are growing the state’s workforce and quality of life.

The “Leading Nebraska” podcast kicks off with an [interview with Robin Gandhi, associate professor of cybersecurity](https://soundcloud.com/leading-nebraska) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.

Gandhi discusses UNO’s leadership in addressing national challenges posed by cybercrime and training the next generation of cybersecurity experts. UNO is one of only [21 institutions](https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-centers/) designated by the National Security Agency as a national Center for Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations.

Growth in cybersecurity-related jobs well outpaces national averages, placing it among the high-growth, high-demand, high-wage fields that will be critical to Nebraska’s future economic prosperity.

“There’s so many (cybersecurity) problems to solve and not enough people to go around,” Gandhi says in the interview.

“The biggest gratitude that I feel is when a student goes to an employer and the employer comes back and says, ‘I want more.’”
