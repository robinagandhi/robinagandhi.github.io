I had an exciting and productive visit to Anahuac University Cordoba/Orizaba campus, which is close to Veracruz, Mexico. 
I learned a lot about the culture, life, and academics at the Cordoba campus, which was very useful for me in thinking about various collaboration opportunities. My meetings with engineering students, coordinators at the Cordoba and Xalapa campuses, members of COPARMEX, and industry partners (TYASA steel plant and others) have resulted in some concrete ideas for furthering the collaboration.
