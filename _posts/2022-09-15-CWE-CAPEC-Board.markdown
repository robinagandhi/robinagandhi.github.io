I am excited to be elected as a [CWE/CAPEC Board Member](https://cwe.mitre.org/about/board.html)! It is a great group of individuals working to promote adoption while improving the coverage and quality of these knowledge bases.

### About the CWE/CAPEC Board

> The mission of the CWE/CAPEC Board is to set and promote the goals and objectives of the CWE/CAPEC Program to ensure the ongoing adoption, coverage, and quality of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™)/Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC™).

> The Board operates according to the CWE/CAPEC Board Charter and the CWE/CAPEC Professional Code of Conduct. Members of the CWE/CAPEC Board include Technical Implementers that provide input and guidance regarding the creation, design, review, maintenance, and applications of CWE/CAPEC entries; Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who are domain experts in weakness and/or attack pattern fields and represent a significant constituency related to, or affected by, CWE/CAPEC; and Advocates who actively support and promote CWE/CAPEC throughout the community in a highly visible and responsible manner.

> Through open and collaborative discussions, Board members provide critical input regarding domain coverage, coverage goals, operating structure, and strategic direction. [Source: <https://cwe.mitre.org/about/board.html>]
