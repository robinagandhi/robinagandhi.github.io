				<h3>Areas of Investigation<span class="nl"></span></h3>

				<p>
				The goal of my research is to develop theories and tools for designing dependable software systems. My research interests are in the areas of information and software assurance, requirements engineering, knowledge-intensive software systems, Certification and Accreditation (C&A), case-study designed research methods, and risk assessment. Here are some key themes of my research directions:
				</p>

				<h2>Study of Software Weakenesses<span class="nl"></span></h2>
				<p>
				To cope with growing software complexity, programmers need better mental models to sense the possibility of a vulnerability. There is no shortage of weakness enumerations and categorization, but they are not in a form that facilitates human understanding and recall. To address these issues, Semantic Templates have been developed at UNO. Using Semantic Templates experiments indicate a definite improvement in the programmer's ability to understand software weaknesses. We are also developing a risk-based approach to understand the impact of code quality on regulatory compliance by systematically mapping regulations to common weaknesses. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Department of Commerce, and DHS Science and Technology Directorate is supporting this research. <br><a href="http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/rgandhi/st/">Link</a><br>

				</p>

				<h2>Assessing Misconceptions that lead to Software Weaknesses<span class="nl"></span></h2>
				<p>
				The primary research goal of this project is to develop a methodology for performance-based assessment instrument for software assurance tasks such as code review. A secondary research goal of this project is to explore fundamental research questions regarding the adequacy of concept inventories to probe misconceptions in cybersecurity knowledge. This proposed project will fulfill the following objectives: First, develop a reliable and valid concept inventory for buffer overflows. Second, create, prototype, and document a method for accelerating the development of concept inventories that can be applied to assess workforce maturity for software assurance tasks.
				</p>

				<h2>Regulatory Requirements Representation and Analysis<span class="nl"></span></h2>
				<p>
				This work explores a multi-dimensional understanding of dependability requirements by taking into account the nexus of constraints, and causal chains in a socio-technical environment where a software system is expected to operate. A recent contribution of this research, presented at a premier conference, is a method to demonstrate early compliance with security requirements using lightweight formalization. We are also investigating approaches to systematically analyze regulatory policies and related security controls. 
				</p>

				<h2>Cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructure<span class="nl"></span></h2>
				<p>
				Solutions for improving the dependability of software systems that provide supervisory control and centralized data acquisition (SCADA) services for critical infrastructure (e.g. power grid railway, water and gas supply, etc.). In this project we leverage the synergy between a Semantic Web-based framework as well as Autonomous Component Based Simulations to rapidly recreate the conditions to assess regulatory compliance. The Air Force Office of Scientific Research and US STRATCOM have supported this research, while OPPD, MUD and Sandia National Labs have expressed interest in it. <a href="http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/rgandhi/stealth/scada.htm">Link</a>
				</p>

				<h2>CyCast: Cyberattack Forecasting System<span class="nl"></span></h2>
				<p>
				The system is intended to monitor the Social, Political, Economical, and Cultural (SPEC) factors worldwide, analyze the related cyber attacks that occur, evaluate the patterns of the attack and build a security model to assess the likelihood of similar attacks that may occur in the future. The Air Force Office of Scientific Research, PayPal and several local businesses have expressed interest in this research. <a href="http://cycast.unomaha.edu">http://cycast.unomaha.edu</a>
