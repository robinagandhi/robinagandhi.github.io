&lt;p&gt;The “Leading Nebraska” podcast kicks off with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/leading-nebraska&quot;&gt;interview with Robin Gandhi, associate professor of cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gandhi discusses UNO’s leadership in addressing national challenges posed by cybercrime and training the next generation of cybersecurity experts. UNO is one of only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-centers/&quot;&gt;21 institutions&lt;/a&gt; designated by the National Security Agency as a national Center for Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth in cybersecurity-related jobs well outpaces national averages, placing it among the high-growth, high-demand, high-wage fields that will be critical to Nebraska’s future economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s so many (cybersecurity) problems to solve and not enough people to go around,” Gandhi says in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The biggest gratitude that I feel is when a student goes to an employer and the employer comes back and says, ‘I want more.’”&lt;/p&gt;
